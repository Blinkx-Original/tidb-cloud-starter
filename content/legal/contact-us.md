Furthermore, we cannot enter into business with companies from countries that endorse modern slavery because of our [position against slavery](https://blinkx.com/statement-against-slavery/), have policies against minorities, or are in favor of payment gaps between genders due to our no-payment gap and diversity policies, which are woven and blended into our [editorial guidelines](https://blinkx.com/terms-and-conditions/) and our [terms of service](https://blinkx.com/terms-and-conditions/).

For Conferences In Schools Against Loot Boxes In Games
------------------------------------------------------

This is part of a Blinkx commitment to the community. We continue with our conferences in schools to inform children and their parents against loot boxes in games as they normalize randomized reward mechanisms for vulnerable people.
