Blinkx at [https://blinkx.com](https://blinkx.com) ("We", "Us", "Our", the "Website") uses cookies. By accessing and using the Website with your browser settings adjusted to accept cookies, you consent to the use of cookies, as you are informed when first accessing our Website.

This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how and why We use our Own and Third-party cookies on our Website, and what are your cookie options, i.e. what you can do if you do not wish to accept cookies from us.

### What are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are sent to and stored in your web browser by most websites you visit. They, for instance, allow the websites you visit (or third-parties) to recognize you as a visitor (but not as an individual), collect analytical data and improve their services and user experience.

Cookies can be divided into two groups: "persistent cookies" and "session cookies". Persistent cookies are saved to the disk and kept there until they expire (depending on their predetermined duration) or until you manually delete them. Session cookies are stored only in memory for the duration of your visit and are therefore deleted as soon as you leave the website (close the browser) and therefore terminate your "session".

Cookies can also be either "first-party" or "third-party". First-party cookies are stored in your browser directly by the website you visit, while third-party cookies are stored by third-party subjects or services, such as advertising platforms, analytics solutions implemented by the website you visit etc.

### How do We use Cookies?

Cookies can be used for a large number of purposes. In the context of what they are used for, cookies can be divided into four categories:

1.  **Strictly necessary cookies** – These are essential so that you can use the website, move around it and fully use its features. Without these, the websites wouldn’t be able to work properly.
2.  **Performance cookies** – These cookies are used to collect data about how visitors use the website, which gives website operators information about how visitors interact with the website. That enables them to improve the functionality of their website.
3.  **Functionality cookies** – These cookies allow websites to remember choices you make, such as your language preference. Thanks to them, you don’t have to change the settings every time you visit a website – the website will remember them for you.
4.  **Targeting and/or advertising cookies** – These cookies are used to show you advertisements more relevant to you.

Third-party cookies from various third-parties are used on our Website. These are in use because of the integration of the services of these third-parties with our Website, namely:

*   Google Analytics
*   Mouseflow
*   YouTube

Google Analytics records analytical data about the visitors of this Website, their individual visits and interaction with the Website. You can read more about Google Analytics and related cookies at [https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage). Also, feel free to read more about how Google Analytics safeguards your data at [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245). You can opt-out from Google Analytics at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). This will stop Google Analytics from tracking your visits not only on our Website, but globally.

This Website uses Mouseflow: a website analytics tool that provides session replay, heatmaps, funnels, form analytics, feedback campaigns, and similar features/functionality. Mouseflow may record your clicks, mouse movements, scrolling, form fills (keystrokes) in non-excluded fields, pages visited and content, time on site, browser, operating system, device type (desktop/tablet/phone), screen resolution, visitor type (first time/returning), referrer, anonymized IP address, location (city/country), language, and similar meta data. Mouseflow does not collect any information on pages where it is not installed, nor does it track or collect information outside your web browser. If you'd like to opt-out, you can do so at [https://mouseflow.com/opt-out](https://mouseflow.com/opt-out). If you'd like to obtain a copy of your data, make a correction, or have it erased, please contact us first or, as a secondary option, contact Mouseflow at privacy@mouseflow.com.
