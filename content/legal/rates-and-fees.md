Blinkx.com is not a lender and never makes credit decisions. For this reason, the service cannot provide the users of the website with any information regarding the rates and fees associated with particular online personal loan products and the offers, provided by the lenders matched with the users of the website. However, blinkx.com is striving hard to ensure that the lenders in our network strictly adhere to all applicable international, federal, state and local regulations and laws and able to provide fair credit practices within the industry.

Usually, this credit is associated with relatively high financial charges, rates and fees. For this reason, the industry is heavily regulated on federal, state and local levels. Moreover, the number or organizations, either governmental or non-governmental, which provide control over the agents in this industry and establish the best practices and regulative procedures, steadily grow and develop.

We provide the [users of the website](https://blinkx.com/) with multiple resources and educational material, which can help study the industry and understand their options better to get positive credit experience. Thus, we recommend using the websites of [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/) and the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/), two government agencies responsible for creating and enforcing the laws and acts that govern online personal lending and protect consumers from the cases of unfair lending practices and discrimination.

In order to protect consumers from unfair lending practices, many states have implemented their own regulations in addition to federal laws. Individual states may govern the terms including but not limited to the maximum allowable loan amount, the charges that lenders are able to apply to loans, the number of rollovers (renewals) and term specifications that are available, the late fees that may be applied and the number of outstanding loans that consumer can have at a time. Follow the link to this [official website](http://paydayloaninfo.org/state-information) and [this resource](http://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/payday-lending-state-statutes.aspx) to get all the necessary information regarding the regulations in your state. Please check back before applying, as these regulations are subject to changes at any time.

The states in which online personal loans are prohibited include but not limited to Arkansas, New York, Vermont and West Virginia. This list is not exhaustive and subject to changes at any time without prior notice. Please, check the official websites listed above to follow the changes in state regulations regarding online personal lending.
