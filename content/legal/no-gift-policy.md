Our readers rely on Blinkx for accuracy and objectivity, whether in the form of data, analytics, comparisons, or reviews. We have [very firm values](https://blinkx.com/about/), we protect our prospective [investors](https://blinkx.com/investors/) and [readers](https://blinkx.com/faq/) with our [editorial guidelines](https://blinkx.com/editorial-guidelines/), [privacy](https://blinkx.com/privacy-policy/), [sitemap transparency](https://blinkx.com/sitemap/), [responsible lending](https://blinkx.com/responsible-lending-policy/), and honest [marketing practices](https://blinkx.com/marketing-practices/).

We also foster the best in our local community with our [diversity policies](https://blinkx.com/diversity-policy/) and our position [against modern slavery](https://blinkx.com/statement-against-slavery/) in our procurement of services.

As such, we believe it is imperative that the [employees](https://blinkx.com/careers/) and members of [our team](https://blinkx.com/meet-our-team/) refrain from any activity that appears to create a conflict of interest, any form of favoritism, or even the appearance of impropriety.

We do not receive presents or gifts from any third party with whom we do or wish to do, business. The only exception is for small presents of token value, such as branded notebooks and pens. Any gift beyond token value cannot be accepted. This includes books and bottles of alcohol. Candy, pastries, and local delicatessens can be accepted and consumed by the recipient in moderation.

Gifts to third parties must be given for a legitimate business purpose that is appropriate and customary, and must not be lavish or excessive. Gifts of cash and cash equivalents are strictly prohibited as well as against our [terms](https://blinkx.com/terms-and-conditions/). Offering gifts to government officials, including employees at all levels at state-owned and controlled companies, is not permitted. Employees are welcome to give our branded promotional items in moderation to third parties.
