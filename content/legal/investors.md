Bootstrapping Phase
-------------------

As a news media organization, Blinkx completed the bootstrapping phase of development. During that stage, the company relied on personal savings, loans, and funds from family and friends to fund its operations, as it works to establish its brand, build its team, and develop a minimum viable product (MVP). You can follow the Bootstrapping, Seeding, and Series A phases in [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blinkx).

To achieve its goal of providing timely and insightful coverage of the latest developments in the world of business and finance, Blinkx is focusing on conducting extensive market research to identify gaps in the market and opportunities for growth. This research will help the company to determine its target audience, understand their needs, and develop content that resonates with them.

In addition, Blinkx is building a team of experienced journalists and industry experts who are passionate about providing high-quality reviews and analysis. The team is working to establish relationships with key sources and industry insiders, and to build a strong brand identity that sets the company apart from its competitors.

As part of its efforts to build a minimum viable product, Blinkx developed a website and social media channels, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blinkx), established [editorial guidelines](https://blinkx.com/editorial-guidelines/) and standards, and defined to use of a content management system (CMS) that will allow the team to efficiently produce and distribute content. In that effort, our company moved from Ghost to Contentful and finally decided on WordPress.

This will help the company to deliver high-quality reviews and analysis to its readers and establish itself as a trusted source of information in the industry.

During the bootstrapping phase, Blinkx is working to establish a [sustainable business model](https://blinkx.com/corporate/blog/postid1/) that will generate revenue and support the [company's growth](https://blinkx.com/blog/blinkx-search/) over the long term. This may involve generating revenue from [advertising](https://blinkx.com/advertiser-disclosure/), [affiliate deals](https://blinkx.com/affiliate-disclosure/), or other sources, and reinvesting that revenue into the business to support further growth and development.

Overall, Blinkx is committed to building a successful and sustainable news media organization that delivers high-quality content and insights to its readers. While the bootstrapping phase was just the beginning of the company's journey, it represents an important first step in achieving this goal.
