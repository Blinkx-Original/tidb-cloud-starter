We have a team of contributing writers in software testing and personal finances. We will have a specialist in home improvement and real estate too.

[Contact us](https://blinkx.com/contact/) to see when we have open positions. We protect freelance and staff collaborators according to our [diversity policy](https://blinkx.com/diversity-policy/) and the lack of [gender pay-gap](https://blinkx.com/gender-pay-gap/).

We do not hire from countries that might engage in [modern slavery](https://blinkx.com/statement-against-slavery/) as we have strict protocols against it. We follow also uncompromising standards for the [careers](https://blinkx.com/careers/) of those who work with us. We expect the contributing freelance writers to become familiar with our [strict editorial guidelines](https://blinkx.com/editorial-guidelines/).

You are in safe hands, just like our readers.
