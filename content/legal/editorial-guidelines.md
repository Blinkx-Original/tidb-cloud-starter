### Key principles

Blinkx is guided by the following key principles:

*   Our content is accurate, helpful, and 100% unbiased. We only publish content that is helpful and actionable.
*   Our sources are trustworthy and reputable. We always link to them so that you can check them for yourself. We always seek experts to provide their insights and perspectives in our articles to ensure that our readers have access to the best information.
*   Our reviews are honest and objective. We never accept free products or services in exchange for a review. We believe that this would compromise our editorial integrity. We are transparent about our affiliate relationships. We want you to know that we may earn a commission when you click on certain links on our website. However, this does not impact our editorial decisions or the quality of our content.

BLINKX is committed to publishing accurate and helpful information. Our editorial team fact-checks each piece of content before it is published for accuracy and relevance. We ensure that the information in each article is kept up-to-date as new information is made available or old information changes.

Writers, assigning editors, and copy editors work together to ensure that all information is properly fact-checked.

Our writers are required to source all of their information, and we only publish content from authoritative sources that we trust. This includes relevant resources, such as trade associations, industry websites, data, and documents to ensure that our content is as accurate and thorough as possible.

When we discover an informational error, we update the article where it occurred with a correction. If you spot an error, mistake, or outdated information in one of our articles, please let us know so that we can correct it.
