**Our Commitment to Investors**
-------------------------------

### **Prioritizing Investor Interests**

At Blinkx, our investors are not just financial backers; they are integral partners in our journey. We deeply value the trust and confidence they place in us, and in return, we prioritize their interests in every decision we make. As a startup, we understand the risks and rewards associated with early-stage investments, and we are committed to ensuring that our investors see a return on their belief in us.

### **Transparency and Open Communication**

1.  **Regular Updates**: We believe in keeping our investors informed at every step. Whether it's a significant milestone, a new partnership, or a challenge we're facing, our investors are the first to know.

3.  **Financial Reporting**: We are committed to transparent financial reporting. Our investors receive regular financial statements, ensuring they have a clear understanding of our financial health and growth trajectory.

### **Being a Startup: Our Journey**

As a startup, we are in the dynamic phase of rapid growth, innovation, and evolution. This stage is characterized by agility, adaptability, and a relentless drive to achieve our vision. While this journey is exciting, it also comes with its set of challenges. Our commitment to our investors is to navigate these challenges with integrity, transparency, and a focus on long-term success.

### **Startup Funding Stages**

#### **Pre-seed Funding**

This is the initial stage where founders invest their own money or obtain funds from close friends and family to bring their idea to life. It's typically used to build a prototype or conduct market research.

#### **Seed Funding**

Once the concept is proven, startups seek seed funding to further develop their product and initiate operations. This funding often comes from angel investors or early-stage venture capitalists.

#### **Series A**

At this stage, startups have a working product and a clear business model. Series A funding is used to optimize the product and scale operations. It's typically sourced from venture capital firms.

#### **Series B**

Startups that reach this stage are ready to expand, whether it's entering new markets or diversifying the product range. Series B funding supports these growth initiatives.

#### **Series C & Beyond**

By Series C, startups are well-established and are looking for funding to develop new products, acquire other businesses, or expand globally. Subsequent rounds (Series D, E, and so on) might follow based on the company's needs and growth trajectory.

#### **Initial Public Offering (IPO)**

An IPO represents a significant milestone where the company goes public, allowing the general public to buy its shares. It provides substantial capital for the company and allows early investors to sell their shares and realize their returns.

At Blinkx, we are committed to guiding our investors through each of these stages, ensuring they are well-informed and confident in the growth and direction of our startup. Our promise is to remain transparent, accountable, and dedicated to delivering value at every step of our journey together.

Sustainability Inside Blinkx
----------------------------

### **Embracing a Paperless Ethos**

At Blinkx, we recognize the environmental impact of paper consumption, both in terms of deforestation and the energy-intensive process of paper production. As part of our commitment to sustainability:

1.  **Digital Operations**: We have transitioned to fully digital operations, eliminating the need for paper in our day-to-day activities. From internal communications to external client interactions, everything is conducted electronically.
2.  **Virtual Meetings**: Instead of in-person meetings that might require printed materials, we utilize virtual meeting platforms, ensuring that information sharing remains digital.
3.  **Electronic Documentation**: All our documentation, from contracts to reports, is stored and shared electronically, reducing the need for physical storage and minimizing our carbon footprint.

### **Striving for Carbon Neutrality**

Being carbon neutral means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases emitted with an equivalent amount offset or absorbed from the atmosphere. At Blinkx, we are actively working towards this goal:

1.  **Energy Efficiency**: We invest in energy-efficient equipment and practices, reducing our overall energy consumption. This includes using energy-efficient servers, lighting, and other office equipment.
2.  **Renewable Energy**: Where possible, we source our energy from renewable sources such as wind or solar, further reducing our carbon emissions.
3.  **Carbon Offsetting**: For the emissions we cannot eliminate, we invest in carbon offset projects. These projects might include reforestation or supporting renewable energy initiatives in communities.
4.  **Regular Audits**: We conduct periodic environmental audits to assess our carbon footprint and identify areas for improvement.
5.  **Employee Education**: Our team is educated about the importance of carbon neutrality and is empowered with strategies to reduce their personal carbon footprints, both in the workplace and at home.

Achieving carbon neutrality is a continuous process. As we grow and evolve, we remain committed to assessing, adapting, and improving our sustainability practices. We are also exploring partnerships with environmental organizations and experts to guide us on this journey.

At Blinkx, sustainability is not just a buzzword; it's an integral part of our ethos. We believe that by taking these proactive measures, we can make a positive impact on the environment and set a standard for responsible business practices in our industry.

**No Gift Policy**
------------------

### **Our Commitment to Integrity and Impartiality**

At Blinkx, we prioritize maintaining the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and impartiality in all our business interactions. To safeguard these values and prevent any potential conflicts of interest or perceptions of impropriety, we have implemented a strict "No Gift Policy."

1.  **Prohibition of Material Gifts**: Employees and representatives of Blinkx are prohibited from accepting any gifts, favors, or hospitality that have a significant monetary value or could be perceived as an attempt to influence business decisions.
2.  **Exception for Symbolic Gifts**: Recognizing that gift-giving can be a customary way of expressing appreciation or marking special occasions, we permit the acceptance of small, symbolic gifts. These are gifts that hold sentimental value rather than material worth.
3.  **Clear Definition**: A symbolic gift is typically one that carries a company logo, represents cultural or local traditions, or is given as a token of appreciation during public events. Examples might include branded stationery, local handicrafts, or commemorative items from conferences.
4.  **Monetary Threshold**: To provide clarity, we have set a modest monetary threshold for acceptable gifts. Any gift exceeding this value is considered a material gift and should not be accepted.
5.  **Mandatory Reporting**: If an employee or representative is offered or receives a gift, they are required to report it to their immediate supervisor or the designated compliance officer. This ensures transparency and allows for an assessment of the gift's appropriateness.
6.  **Return of Inappropriate Gifts**: In situations where a gift exceeds our defined threshold or is deemed inappropriate, the gift will be returned with a polite explanation about our company's policy.

### **Rationale Behind the Policy**

1.  **Avoiding Conflicts of Interest**: By limiting gift acceptance, we ensure that our business decisions remain unbiased and are not influenced by external factors.
2.  **Maintaining Trust**: Our stakeholders, partners, and clients can trust that our interactions are genuine and not swayed by gifts or favors.
3.  **Promoting a Culture of Integrity**: The policy reinforces a culture where integrity and ethical behavior are paramount.

### **Continuous Education and Awareness**

1.  **Training**: All Blinkx employees and representatives undergo regular training on our "No Gift Policy" to ensure they understand its importance and how to adhere to it.
2.  **Open Communication**: We encourage open dialogue about the policy, allowing team members to seek clarification or guidance when faced with potential gift-related dilemmas.

At Blinkx, our "No Gift Policy" is more than just a set of rules; it's a reflection of our commitment to ethical business practices. By setting clear boundaries and promoting a culture of transparency and integrity, we aim to build and maintain trust with all our stakeholders.

Gambling For Fun And For Money
------------------------------

Our site has several articles discussing online casinos, through [Casino Blinkx](https://casino.blinkx.com), the RTP coefficients in different slots, casino licensing, and all types of related gambling content.

We have the mission to help hardcore players with the following

Trust: We verify the registration of online casinos and analyze if there is an established support service and payment processing. We also test the activation of games inside gaming platforms to detect possible scams or misleading advertisements. User reviews, surveys, and user votes integrate with our independent analysis and field testing as users to identify key information and provide an encompassing analysis of online gaming platforms and online betting and casino organizations.

Experience: From our writers and reviewers to discuss gaming platforms, software providers, payment processors, and withdrawal times.

Knowledge: We provide free expertise and analysis about topics that will help players to perform better decisions, such as analysis of the return-to-player coefficient ratios, and codes for non-gambling games.

Protection From Addiction: We have verified gambling addiction content and we always provide links that encourage players to obtain protection from addictions.

### **Our Content Is Free**

When it comes to selecting the online casino that is most suitable for them, we think that all players must have exposure to guidance that is both trustworthy and expert-level. For this reason, our visitors will never be required to pay in order for using Blinkx.

Our ability to provide our services without charging a charge is made possible by the fact that some of the casinos that we feature pay us a commission whenever their customers come to them through our website.

This enables us to engage top experts in the field who are always contributing to our collection of over three hundred casino evaluations and provides support for the massive infrastructure that is necessary for our website. In addition, each month we invest hundreds of hours into bringing you the most comprehensive guides, news pieces, tools, and exclusive games possible.

Casinos have no say in the creation of our material, and our suggestions are unbiased and based on research, all to ensure that you get the most out of your time spent gambling. Notwithstanding the fact that a fee was paid to us by any of the casinos included on our website, each one was subjected to a comprehensive evaluation in accordance with our tough methodology.

When it comes to quality, we are completely rigid, even going so far as to compile a blacklist of online casinos that do not meet our requirements and do not serve the best interests of their customer base.

### **Gambling Legislation**

The laws governing gambling are evolving all the time on a global scale, and our devoted Newscast is here to keep you up to date on all the most recent developments. You can play with complete peace of mind knowing that every online casino we offer to you, no matter where in the globe it is located, has a valid license from a recognized government agency. In order to protect you, if we discover that any casinos have violated any compliance rules, we will add those casinos to our blacklist of websites that you should steer clear of.

### **Responsible Gaming**

More than two billion individuals throughout the globe participate in gambling activities, with the vast majority of us seeing it as nothing more than a source of amusement. On the other hand, gambling may become more than just an innocuous kind of entertainment for some individuals and instead lead to serious issues, which may be an indication of an addiction to gambling.

Do you have more money riding on this than you can manage to lose? Are you trying to get back your economic loss? Are you feeling stressed and anxious as a result of your gambling?

Software testing

I am a sales strategist and I write for other blogs about logistics and POS systems.

Here I review SaaS platforms according to a specific template of topics that have to be covered.

After the review, I have to give my personal opinion and also the readers can provide their opinion and vote.

### Mr. S. Krone

_Online casino platforms and RTP coefficients_

I review online casino platforms. An online casino is also a SaaS platform and I test if they are trustable, how is the user interface, how to withdraw your money, and how to deposit.

After my review is published, the users can also vote on the casino and leave comments.

I also write about technical topics such as the RTP coefficients.

This is one of the most important discussions and I see that some reviewers overlook it.

For example, which slot offers the highest RTP coefficient in this casino? I want to know so I play on that slot, right?

Hello, I am Marci[o](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10325246). You can find me [in my author page](http://home.blinkx.com/author/marcio). I am an architect and designer, alma mater is Mackenzie. Retired in theory, but an architect never retires completely. Along with architectural projects, I am a filmmaker and have completed some short documentaries. Filmmaking and design are my passions. In [Home Blinkx](http://wikidata.org/wiki/Q119889739) I write about home decoration and foundations. The goal is to teach homeowners to DYI as much as possible, and when this is not possible, enable them through knowledge, to evaluate service quotations and choose the best service technicians.

I am a [gambler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24114117), an attorney, a [poker player](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15295720), and a father of two princesses. I started at the beginning of the century with the first online casinos. I am also a gambling write[r,](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16186593) and poker player, as I said, something different from just being a gambler. In [Blinkx](https://casino.blinkx.com), I review online casinos, a task in which I am very experienced[.I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adikes_Bond) study their pros and cons, their payment and withdrawal options, their look and feel, and check their licenses. I am a Microgaming fan, but very objective here in my articles. I hope you enjoy reading my [blog](http://www.johnbondwriting.com/) and these articles too.
