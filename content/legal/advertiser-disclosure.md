Information You Can Trust: You Are In Safe Hands
------------------------------------------------

We think that everybody should be capable of making sound financial and business choices. We also think that you have to access this information and comparisons for free, without limitations on the articles you can read, and without registration.

And, although our site does not showcase every firm or financial product accessible, we are happy that the advice we give, the information we supply, and the tools we provide are impartial, unbiased, transparent – and completely free.

We have a [sitemap transparency](https://blinkx.com/sitemap/) policy and a [no-gift policy](https://blinkx.com/no-gift-policy/) in place. We do not receive any kind of gifts and we publish our sitemap to the public.

You are our first priority.

So How Do We Make Money?
------------------------

If all calculators and services are free if access to our articles is free and without registration, how do we make money? How do we maintain the hosting service, get [investors](https://blinkx.com/investors/), and pay our writers and web designers?

We have advertisements placed programmatically on our website by Google and its business partner Ezoic. Ezoic is an advertisement network and we started to work with them in 2020. We have already a couple of publisher success managers which are already our friends.

We do not choose who advertises on our site or where. Google and Ezoic algorithms do that based on a number of factors that we have no control over. They manage that the advertisement is not intrusive and does not cover the content.

As our advertisements have to be appropriate for the whole family, we have only turned down political advertisers like NGOs and charity groups. Also, we dismissed ads about adult and sexual interest, tobacco, drugs, CBD, firearms, and gambling.

While all the aforementioned activities are legal and can be advertised, we have turned them down as our content can remain family-friendly and suitable for all readers.

As an Amazon Associate, we may earn a small commission from qualifying purchases if you click to Amazon from this site and choose to make a purchase. We explain this in our [affiliate disclosure](https://blinkx.com/affiliate-disclosure/).

Furthermore, our associates compensate us for leads or referrals sent to their businesses. This does not influence the topics we write about, as we also receive compensation for having ads.

Our business partners, usually suppliers of goods and providers of services for business owners, have no effect on our recommendations or advice, which are based on the study and compilation of costs and prices. Our sponsors can't pay us to make sure that good things are said about their products or services or [give us gifts](https://blinkx.com/no-gift-policy/) of any kind.

All the information we provide follows our strict [editorial guidelines](https://blinkx.com/editorial-guidelines/). This includes [our team](https://blinkx.com/meet-our-team/) and the freelancers and contributors that [collaborate with us](https://blinkx.com/careers/) and are hired following our very open [diversity policy](https://blinkx.com/diversity-policy/) from countries that [do not have modern slavery](https://blinkx.com/statement-against-slavery/).

Important Disclosures. Please Read Carefully.
---------------------------------------------

Persons facing serious financial difficulties should consider other alternatives or should seek out professional financial advice.

This website is not an offer to lend. Blinkx.com is not a lender or lending partner and does not make loan or credit decisions. Blinkx.com connects interested persons with a lender or lending partner from its network of approved lenders and lending partners. Blinkx.com does not control and is not responsible for the actions or inactions of any lender or lending partner, is not an agent, representative or broker of any lender or lending partner, and does not endorse any lender or lending partner. Blinkx.com receives compensation from its lenders and lending partners, often based on a ping-tree model similar to Google AdWords where the highest available bidder is connected to the consumer. Regardless, Blinkx.com’s service is always free to you. In some cases, you may be given the option of obtaining a loan from a tribal lender. Tribal lenders are subject to tribal and certain federal laws while being immune from state law including usury caps. If you are connected to a tribal lender, please understand that the tribal lender’s rates and fees may be higher than state-licensed lenders. Additionally, tribal lenders may require you to agree to resolve any disputes in a tribal jurisdiction. You are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan offered by any lender, whether tribal or state-licensed, and to reject any particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.

This service is not available in all states. If you request to connect with a lender or lending partner in a particular state where such loans are prohibited, or in a location where Blinkx.com does not have an available lender or lending partner, you will not be connected to a lender or lending partner. You are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan offered by any lender or lending partner, and to reject any particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.

By submitting your information via this website, you are authorizing Blinkx.com partners to do a credit check, which may include verifying your social security number, driver license number or other identification, and a review of your creditworthiness.

You also authorize Blinkx.com to share your information and credit history with a network of approved lenders and lending partners.

### **Lender’s or Lending Partner’s Disclosure of Terms.**

The lenders and lending partners you are connected to will provide documents that contain all fees and rate information pertaining to the loan being offered, including any potential fees for late-payments and the rules under which you may be allowed (if permitted by applicable law) to refinance, renew or rollover your loan. Loan fees and interest rates are determined solely by the lender or lending partner based on the lender’s or lending partner’s internal policies, underwriting criteria and applicable law. Blinkx.com has no knowledge of or control over the loan terms offered by a lender and lending partner. You are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan offered by any lenders and lending partners and to reject any particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.

### **Late Payments Hurt Your Credit Score**

Please be aware that missing a payment or making a late payment can negatively impact your credit score. To protect yourself and your credit history, make sure you only accept loan terms that you can afford to repay. If you cannot make a payment on time, you should contact your lenders and lending partners immediately and discuss how to handle late payments.

We think that everybody should be capable of making sound financial choices.

Gambling Disclosures
--------------------

Our site has several articles discussing online casinos, the RTP coefficients in different slots, casino licensing, and all types of related gambling content.

We have the mission to help hardcore players with the following

Trust: We verify the registration of online casinos and analyze if there is an established support service and payment processing. We also test the activation of games inside gaming platforms to detect possible scams or misleading advertisements. User reviews, surveys, and user votes integrate with our independent analysis and field testing as users to identify key information and provide an encompassing analysis of online gaming platforms and online betting and casino organizations.

Experience: From our writers and reviewers to discuss gaming platforms, software providers, payment processors, and withdrawal times.

Knowledge: We provide free expertise and analysis about topics that will help players to perform better decisions, such as analysis of the return-to-player coefficient ratios, and codes for non-gambling games.

Protection From Addiction: We have verified gambling addiction content and we always provide links that encourage players to obtain protection from addictions.

**Our Content Is Free**
-----------------------

When it comes to selecting the online casino that is most suitable for them, we think that all players must have exposure to guidance that is both trustworthy and expert-level. For this reason, our visitors will never be required to pay in order for using Blinkx.

Our ability to provide our services without charging a charge is made possible by the fact that some of the casinos that we feature pay us a commission whenever their customers come to them through our website.

This enables us to engage top experts in the field who are always contributing to our collection of over three hundred casino evaluations and provides support for the massive infrastructure that is necessary for our website. In addition, each month we invest hundreds of hours into bringing you the most comprehensive guides, news pieces, tools, and exclusive games possible.

Casinos have no say in the creation of our material, and our suggestions are unbiased and based on research, all to ensure that you get the most out of your time spent gambling. Notwithstanding the fact that a fee was paid to us by any of the casinos included on our website, each one was subjected to a comprehensive evaluation in accordance with our tough methodology.

When it comes to quality, we are completely rigid, even going so far as to compile a blacklist of online casinos that do not meet our requirements and do not serve the best interests of their customer base.

**Gambling Legislation**
------------------------

The laws governing gambling are evolving all the time on a global scale, and our devoted Newscast is here to keep you up to date on all the most recent developments. You can play with complete peace of mind knowing that every online casino we offer to you, no matter where in the globe it is located, has a valid license from a recognized government agency. In order to protect you, if we discover that any casinos have violated any compliance rules, we will add those casinos to our blacklist of websites that you should steer clear of.

**Responsible Gambling**
------------------------

More than two billion individuals throughout the globe participate in gambling activities, with the vast majority of us seeing it as nothing more than a source of amusement. On the other hand, gambling may become more than just an innocuous kind of entertainment for some individuals and instead lead to serious issues, which may be an indication of an addiction to gambling.

Do you have more money riding on this than you can manage to lose? Are you trying to get back your economic loss? Are you feeling stressed and anxious as a result of your gambling? The organizations that are mentioned below may provide assistance and guidance for you. You may also learn more about this topic by visiting our section dedicated to [Responsible Gambling](https://blinkx.com/responsible-gambling/).
