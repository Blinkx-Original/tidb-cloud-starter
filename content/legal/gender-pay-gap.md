At Blinkx.com, as we grow and expand through our [extensive career plans](https://blinkx.com/careers/), we are committed to ensuring that our future employees will be compensated fairly and equitably, irrespective of their gender, if they are men or women through our [diversity policies](https://blinkx.com/diversity-policy/) and our clear position [against modern slavery](https://blinkx.com/statement-against-slavery/).

We believe in the principle of equal pay for equal work. Our remuneration policy will be based on the number of hours worked and the nature of the work performed, not on the gender of the employee. We will strive to ensure that all our employees, women or men, will receive equal pay for the same work done during the same hours.

[Blinkx.com](https://blinkx.com/about/) is committed to promoting gender equality between all men and women in all aspects of our operations. We will strive to create a workplace environment that is inclusive, respectful, and free from discrimination. We believe that diversity and inclusion are not just moral imperatives but also key to our success as a business.

We will regularly review our pay practices to ensure that they are fair and non-discriminatory. We will also provide training and education to our managers and employees on the importance of gender equality and the need to avoid unconscious bias towards men or women.

We are committed to transparency and will publish updates on our progress towards achieving gender pay equality. We will also seek external advice and guidance to ensure that our practices are in line with best practices and legal requirements.

We understand that achieving gender pay equality is a journey, not a destination. We are committed to this journey and will work tirelessly to ensure that Blinkx.com is a leader in promoting gender equality in the workplace.

We invite all our stakeholders, including our future employees, to join us in this important endeavor. Together, we can create a workplace that is fair, inclusive, and rewarding for all.
