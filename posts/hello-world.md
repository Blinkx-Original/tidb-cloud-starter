# ðŸ“˜ Catalog Architecture â€“ Governance & SOP

This document explains the **architecture, naming conventions, and workflow** for our Catalog system.  
It is the **reference guide** for development, SEO, affiliate integration, and lead management.

## 1. Concept

The Catalog is the **core of SEO Armageddon**.  
- Every **Product** represents an opportunity to monetize:  
  - Affiliate item (Amazon, Capterra, SaaS tools, etc.)  
  - Lead Management offer (ice machines, forklifts for rent, etc.)  
  - Dropshipping item (real supplier inventory).  
- Products are always grouped into **Categories**.  
- Each Product automatically generates:  
  1. A **Card** (square on the homepage or category page).  
  2. A **Detail Page** (`/product/[slug]`).  
  3. Zero or more **Listings** (affiliate links, offers, vendors).
